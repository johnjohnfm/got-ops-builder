üìú Creator‚Äôs Statement:  
This system was built not merely as code, but as a conceptual architecture‚Äîa living pattern of thought intended to sharpen clarity, guide precision, and promote ethical creativity. By using this tool, you participate in a lineage of design built on integrity, authorship, and truth. Attribution is not a formality‚Äîit‚Äôs the moral signature of collaborative systems thinking.

‚∏ª

üß† PHILOSOPHICAL PREMISE  
This is not just HTML. It is a modular implementation of the GPT OPS framework‚Äîan operational method for prompting, design, and systemic clarity. Unauthorized replication or rebranding severs the tool from its structural intent and undermines the clarity it was meant to uphold.
