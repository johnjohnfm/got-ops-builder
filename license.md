# ✖️ GPT OPS LICENSE  
**Version 2.0**  
**Created by [JOHNJOHNFM](https://johnjohnfm.uk)**

## ✖️ SYSTEM DEFINITION  
The **GPT OPS System** is not merely code — it is a conceptual structure: a method of operational reasoning designed to support ethical clarity, modular logic, and creative integrity. Use of the system implies recognition of its purpose and authorship.

## ✖️ CREATOR’S STATEMENT  
This system embodies more than function.  
It encodes a way of thinking — a principled method for producing clarity, precision, and responsible creativity. Attribution is not a technicality. It is the ethical signature of design authorship, and a defense against the corruption of systems by anonymity or theft.
